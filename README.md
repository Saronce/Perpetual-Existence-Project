##<A name="intro">Concept Introduction</A>
<!-- All section titles look like this because they are also "anchors"--> 
The Perpetual Existence Project exists solely to accomplish one task; called the **<A href="#ptask">"Primary Task"</A>**.  

The **<A name="ptask">Primary Task</A>** is to **"ensure that the Perpetual Existence Project <A href="#existdef">"exists"</A> always."**

That's all. That's it. But this seemingly simple concept has <A href="#implications">**VAST** implications</A>! 

 The **<A href="#ptask">Primary Task</A>** is the ONLY immutable, unchangeable, "perpetual" aspect of the entire Perpetual Existence Project!  
**Everything** else about it; the name, the rules, the members, the language, the organization; EVERYTHING can, and should, be changed to increase the project's chances of survival. 

So whats the <A href="#implications">big deal</A>? Have you figured it out yet?

These hints should wet your appetite (see **<A href="#implications">chapter 4</A>** for an explanation):  
- It will effectively eliminate violence and war from the   face of the Earth  
- It will solve Global Warming, and Overpopulation  
- It will narrow the gap between rich and poor  
- It will increase human health and longevity  
- It will increase your standard of living (it could <A href="#rich">make you rich</A>)  
- It will unite and harmonize humanity

*A note from the <A href="#members">current members</A> of the Perpetual Existence Project:  
Everything in this README, except the <A href="#ptask">Primary Task</A>, has been created by us for the sole purpose of furthuring the <A href="#ptask">Primary Task</A>. And if it is determined that this README, or part of it, interferes with the <A href="#ptask">Primary Task</A> then it should be removed or edited immediately!

##<A name="specific">Getting Specific</A>

The Perpetual Existence Project can be said to *<A name="esistdef">exist</A>* when the following conditions are fufilled:  

1. The Perpetual Existence Project must have at least one, a contributing member. (ie. the ability to proccess information and influence the physical world) 
2. The Perpetual Existence Project must have some dedicated physical record, accessible by at least one member, that includes the <A href="#ptask">Primary Task</A>. (ie. information and instructions for the member/s to proccess)  
3. The Perpetual Existence Project must have the potential to achieve the <A href="#ptask">Primary Task</A> (This is a tricky one; wether or not the Perpetual Existence Project has this potential at any given moment is a matter of opinion)  

*Conditions 1 and 2 arise out of, and are neccessary components of, condition 3.

##<A name="stages">Overview of Project Stages</A>  

REMINDER: These stages are currently just speculation. As previously stated; all aspects of the Perpetual Existence Project, *including its developement,* are subject to change based on their compatability with the <A href="#ptask">Primary Task</A>. The <A href="#members">current project membership</A> has created these stages just to give a rough idea of what the Perpetual Existence Project's developement will probably look like:

The first stage of the Perpetual Existence Project is the **Embryonic Stage**. The Embryonic Stage includes three substages: **Zygote, Blastocyst,** and **Embryo**.  
 
* During the **<A name="zyg">Zygote</A>** stage Sheldonfrith is the only    project contributor. He is mainly concerned with developing the basic concept of the Perpetual Existence Project and learning to effectively communicate the concept to others.

* The **Blastocyst** stage begins when Sheldonfrith convinces at least one (probably 3-5) other trusted person/s to begin contributing significantly to the Perpetual Existence Project. This stage will involve further refining and expansion of the concept. A primary goal will be to choose the collaborative developement environment for the next few stages of the project.

* The **Embryo** stage will be carried out by a small group of specially selected contributors. With most of the focus on figuring out exactly what the Perpetual Existence Project needs to become in order to survive until adulthood. This is the ideal stage for a **major change in direction**.

*Stages become exponentially harder to predict as the project progresses.

The second phase, the **Fetal Stage**, will probably be relatively short and easy compared to the other stages. Most of the focus will probably be on programming. For this reason most recruitement during this stage and the preceding  **Embryo** stage will probably be focused on skilled, trustworthy programmers. The **user interaction environment** must be completed by the end of this stage (it should be designed to last at least until the **Teenage Stage**).  

**Birth** occurs when the **user interaction environment** is completed and released to the public.

Probably one the most critical stages of the Perpetual Existence Project will be the **Infant** stage. The key to surviving infancy will probably be an exponential increase in the user base. The team of developers from the **Fetal Stage** will likely be kept very busy working out the inevitable glitches in the program. This stage will probably require exceptional personal effort with little immediate reward (The Perpetual Existence Project will still lack the means to fully reward contributors).

*Things are very hard to predict at this point. These stages are mostly just speculation.

During the **Childhood** phase the Perpetual Existence Project will hopefully be developing a massive global user base and significant monetary influence(power). At this stage it will probably start to be noticed, maybe even attacked, by governments and corporations. The child project should focus on generously rewarding and motivating its users. This is the probable stage where previous unrewarded contributions will be repaid, with interest!

The **Teenage** stage is impossible to predict. But it could possibly be a very tumultus time for the Perpetual Existence Project and the human race in general. This is the stage where the Perpetual Existence Project will most likely finally assume control of the Earth, hopefully in a nonviolent manner. The highest priorities will probably global threats such as climate change, overpopulation, disease etc.

From **Adulthood** to **Old Age** the Perpetual Existence Project will probably have to make unimaginable, exponential gains in power and intelligence. It will most likely become a spacefaring entity and humans will most likely take on different, less central, roles in the project. This is when cosmic threats (supernovas, black holes, collapse of universe) should probably be adressed. 

The end? Who knows?  
 From our current standpoint it is entirely impossible, and useless, to speculate on what will happen after the farthest observable threat (the collapse of the Universe) has been neutralized.

##<A name="implications">The Vast Implications</A>  
The Perpetual Existence Project is, in essence, an "organization" concerned only with ensuring its own survival. Wait, that sounds terrible! Isn't that essentially what every evil corporation, opressive government, and criminal organization is concerned with; their own survival? Yes, but there is an essential difference: the Perpetual Existence Project is concerned with ensuring its own survival UNTIL THE END OF TIME. All of those harmful organizations are shortsighted and, so to speak, unintelligent. If they really wanted to survive forever they would not be doing "evil" things because they are not sustainable. The Perpetual Existence Project, if it is successful, will be the most powerful force for good the world has ever seen; the key is INTELLIGENCE.  
Explanation of concept **implications**:

In order to "<A href="#exist">exist</A> **ALWAYS**" the Perpetual Existence Project must overcome several inevitable existential threats: the extinction of the human race, the destruction of Earth, the possible eventual collapse of the universe (so-called "big crunch"). This is why, in order to achieve the <A href="#ptask">Primary Task</A>, the project must adopt a policy of "agressive" or "active" survival. These are made up terms that basically mean that the project must "actively" expand and increase its power and knowledge; it cannot simply hide in a corner and wait (this would be "defensive" or "inactive" survival)

So the Perpetual Existence Project must at least be able to prevent the destruction of Earth and humans or it must progress to a point where its survival doesn't depend on either. Barring unforseen alien intervention; the project will probably have to become the most powerfull and intelligent entity on Earth! The only way of achieving this type of global success is by offering huge benefits to everyone who contributes

##<A name="status">Current Project Status</A>

Current Perpetual Existence Project **<A name="members">Members</A>**:  
1. Sheldonfrith (project founder)

The Perpetual Existence Project is currently in the <A href="#zyg">zygote</A> stage.

----------

##<A name="needs">What We Need Right Now</A>

----------

##<A name="succeed">Will We Succeed?</A>

We're not sure.... but considering this is a project with the sole goal of succeeding.... we probably will!

BUT, the project's success still depends entirely on having a dedicated, intelligent membership base. This is where **YOU** come in:
<A name="rich"></A>
Everyone who makes a significant contribution during this crucial stage of the project will be considered a Perpetual Existence Project **founder**. In order to achieve the <A href="#ptask">Primary Task</A> the Perpetual Existence Project must generously and consistently reward its contributors. The <A href="#members">current membership</A> is working on a credit-based-reward-system for those who contribute *before* the project has the means to adequately reward them. Making contributions at this early stage of the project is like getting to invest in Apple back in 1984! If the project succeeds **founders** WILL be richly rewarded! 

So **join now**, contribute, and you will be rewarded when the project begins to take off! 

----------

##<A name="join">How to Join</A>

Currently you must be **invited** by one of the <A href="#members">project members</A> to join the Perpetual Existence Project. 

At this stage the Perpetual Existence Project is only looking for VERY dedicated, intelligent, skilled, and most importantly, **trusted** members. At this stage the project is very vulnerable to sabotage so *trust* is the main criteria. 

However... If you have read this README and really want to be a part of this project, it is still possible (even if you dont know any of the <A href="#members">current members</A> personally): Because the Perpetual Existence Project is currently in a public repository on GitHub anyone can fork and edit it. So **if you want to prove yourself we suggest that you start making some major positive contributions to the project** and send us pull requests and messages. However we will only consider you for membership if you are clearly putting A LOT of work into improving the project.
